1.import sql file to mysql
2.to build the java solution use jdk13 or a version below
3.to connect to the database download mysqlconnector and add the path to the project.
To do that get to the properties and add the jar file containing mysqlconnector.jar

note:the sql file is far from complete, it's just a little sample to check if the app is working well.
